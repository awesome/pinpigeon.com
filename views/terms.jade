Negotiations will begin upon written notice. PinPigeon will send its notice to your billing address and email you a copy to the email address you have provided to us.

                          | If the parties fail to resolve a Claim through negotiations, within such thirty (30)-day period, either you or PinPigeon may elect to have the Claim (except as otherwise provided in Section 20.6) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the "JAMS Rules") and under the terms set forth in this ToS. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section 20 and the JAMS Rules, the terms in this Section 20  will control and prevail.

As part of the arbitration, both you and we will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim.  The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator's decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator's findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator's decision is based.  The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator.  Except as otherwise provided in this ToS, (i) you and PinPigeon may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (ii) the arbitrator's decision is final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law.

If we are initiating arbitration for a Claim, we will pay all costs charged by JAMS for initiating the arbitration.  All other fees and costs of the arbitration will be charged pursuant to the JAMS Rules.

In the absence of a notice to conduct the arbitration in your hometown area, the arbitration will be conducted in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or internet connection appearances.
